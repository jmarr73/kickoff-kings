## Quick Start (Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmarr73/kickoff-kings.git
cd kickoff-kings
````

### 1) Setup environment

Run the provided script to generate secrets and configure users:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The script will:

- Ask for your domain (or leave blank for local testing)
- Ask for the season year and type
- Ask how many users you want and their usernames
- Auto-generate secure random values for `FLASK_SECRET` and user tokens
- Write a ready-to-use `.env` file
- Show you your login URLs

If you‚Äôd rather create `.env` manually, here‚Äôs the format:

```ini
FLASK_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-string
TOKEN_USER1=replace-with-random-token
TOKEN_USER2=replace-with-random-token
NFL_YEAR=2025
NFL_SEASONTYPE=2
BUILD_ID=localdev
```

You can generate secure values like this:

```bash
# Flask secret (64 hex chars)
openssl rand -hex 32

# User tokens (48 hex chars each)
openssl rand -hex 24
```

---

### 2) Run locally (no HTTPS)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.basic.yml up -d --build
```

Open: [http://localhost:8000/login/user1/YOUR\_TOKEN](http://localhost:8000/login/user1/YOUR_TOKEN)

---

### 3) Run on a VPS with HTTPS (Caddy + Let‚Äôs Encrypt)

1. Point a DNS record (e.g., `picks.yourdomain.com`) ‚Üí your VPS IP.
2. Edit the `Caddyfile` in this repo to match your domain.
3. Start with:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.caddy.yml up -d --build
   ```

4. Open: [https://picks.yourdomain.com/login/user1/YOUR\_TOKEN](https://picks.yourdomain.com/login/user1/YOUR_TOKEN)

| ---------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `FLASK_SECRET`   | (none)  | Long random string for Flask sessions                  |
| `TOKEN_USER1`    | (none)  | Token for `user1` login URL                            |
| `TOKEN_USER2`    | (none)  | Token for `user2` login URL                            |
| `NFL_YEAR`       | `2025`  | Season year                                            |

## Data Persistence

All saved under `./data/` on the host (mounted into the container):

- Picks: `picks-<year>-<week>.json`
- Cached schedules: `schedule-<year>-<week>-t<type>.json`
- Cached results: `results-<year>-week-<week>-t<type>.json`

---

## Refresh Results

On a week‚Äôs Results page, click **üîÑ Refresh Results** to bypass cache and pull live scores.

---

## VPS Deployment (Linode Example, Ubuntu 22.04)

1. Create a Linode (Nanode 1GB is enough).
2. In DNS (e.g., Namecheap), add an **A record** pointing `picks.yourdomain.com` ‚Üí VPS IP.
3. Paste the `cloud-init-linode.yaml` contents into **User Data** when creating the Linode.
4. Edit placeholders (`GIT_REPO`, `DOMAIN`, `.env` values) before use.
5. After 1‚Äì2 minutes, visit `https://picks.yourdomain.com`.

## Development

- App entrypoint: `app.py`
- Static assets in `static/` (includes `favicon.svg` football icon)
- Run locally without Docker (for development):

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python app.py
  ```
